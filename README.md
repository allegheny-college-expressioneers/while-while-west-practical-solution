# While, While West Practical

1. Write a program that converts a temperature to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program should ask the user for the temperature and its unit to convert. It should also handle the case in which the user does not provide either `C`, `c`, `F`, or `f` as the temperature units. Remember that temperatures are expressed as integers, so the converted temperature should be printed as an integer.

The conversion formulas are:

**Degrees in Fahrenheit = 9/5 * Degrees in Celsius + 32**
**Degrees in Celsius = (Degrees in Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9**

2. Write a Python program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. The program should ask the user for the lengths of all three sides. Remember that:
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

3. Write a program that prints `'And I would walk 500 miles'` one thousand times.

4. Write a program that randomly generates a number between one and 100 and asks the user to guess it. If the user guesses incorrectly, tell them whether they have guessed too high or too low and ask them to guess again. Keep asking the user to guess, giving feedback about whether their guess was too high or too low, until the user guesses the correct number, at which point you should tell the user they were right and exit the program.
